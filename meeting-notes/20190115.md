## Agenda

1. Start recording
1. Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
1. Ask for a volunteer to take notes
1. Everyone can add items to this agenda for things they would like to discuss
1. Round of intros and updates
  - Introduce yourself and your interest in this subject
  - What have you accomplished since the last meeting?
  - Were there any blockers? If so, which ones? Is it still blocked? Why?
  - What is the next important thing you should focus on?
1. Questions
  - When will we discuss the new name of peer-base?
    - "Really soon" - let's not bikeshed it in public forums
  - Prioritize https://github.com/peer-base/peer-base/issues/146 (Allowing pinner to pin content from within a collaboration ) ?
    - becoming a blocker!
    - Dx and infra issues to discuss. (we dont want to recreate core IPFS infrastructure for pinning)
    - its a missing feature that developers will need (let's lay out the options and pick one)
    - how about peer-base pinner that calls out to an ipfs pinner? A strategy / facade so we can switch out which service we use behind the scenes...  in mem vs ipfs gateway vs 3rd party pinning service.
  - Pinner for Peer-Pad
  - Mesure the benefit and how hard it would be to use any kind of CRDT for peer-base, op-based, state-based, delta-crdt, ron-based crdts, ...?
    - if we can see any use-case that would benefit from using other types of CRDT, we should look at abstracting the CRDT implementation details from peer-base
    - the basic primitive could be a causal tree. we could map that to any library for pure op-based crdts
    - imagine an ecosystem of adapters, e.g peer-base-crdt-automerge, peer-base-crdt-ron, etc..
    - the replication strategy may be coupled to the crdt impl choice.
    - connection management is unique, we should factor that out... but it should be pushed to libp2p
    - automerge gives a json/object like api, swarm.js has uses graphql..
    - main goal is an easy to use api, not a unified api across all existing crdt libraries
  - There's a GraphSync (how to perform replication and queries on DAGs) discussion tomorrow. Are there any use cases we really want supported?
    - what about sparse sub-graph requests (get record 500 from a huge dataset)
    - optimised transmission of an entire graph of blocks... (i think that is all graphsync is aiming for)
    - streamable (and cancellable? observable and informative, renderable in a UI)

1. Actions
  - Please review https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log/issues/211#issuecomment-454012202 (how to handle breaking changes on data-structures and public API on ipfs-log)
  - @pgte @satazor Make time to Prioritize https://github.com/peer-base/peer-base/issues/146
