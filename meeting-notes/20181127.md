#### @marcooliveira

- In progress
  - Sync with what the Design WG did while I was away
    - Update design file structure based in discussions with Design WG
    - Define where design assets will be stored and shared
    - Define how DDC WG (and others) should interact and request from Design WG
  - Create table of possible statuses, intervenients and message for each one
    - Once we have a solution, will present to DDC to gather feedback, then it should become recommended UX for all peer-star apps (Peerpad, Discussify, IDM)
    - Might require information on peer-star that is not yet available for dev
  - Discuss how to launch "more public BETA" of Discussify
    - Why?
      -  Not a real launch, we just want to make it easier to get beta testers on board, gather feedback and release updates
    - Where
      - Chrome Web Store
      - Add-ons for Firefox
    - To improve
      - Extension banner will likely change: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-discussify/issues/64
      - Peers/Pinning connectivity/consistency status; review with Sousa

- Blocked
  - Launch public BETA of Discussify
    - Finish versidag and integrate it into discussify
    - Pinner integration
    - Versioning + TTL of data (to enable quick iterations)
      - Need to ping Victor about this
    - Who owns the key to publish?
    - For Firefox Add-ons, need to generate slightly different manifest

- Next
  - Discussify: Copy & image for stores. Brand manual will be useful
  - Find solutions for gathering feedback and metrics from BETA testers
  - Find influencers & mediums where to announce effort and gather interest
  - Discussify: Launch public BETA

- Notes

- Discuss with Pedro (open issue)
  - All the pending issues/decisions to be done for launching Discussify
  - Influencers we could use, who could write about us?
  - GUI WG is discussing set of components that could be integrated into apps, might be interested in the UX for syncing status.
