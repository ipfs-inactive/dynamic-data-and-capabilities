[![#ipfs-dynamic-data](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs--dynamic--data-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-dynamic-data)

> Research and development of building blocks that enable collaborative applications, providing solutions for security, identity, access control, concurrency, synchronization, offline and near-real-time collaboration on top of IPFS.

## Responsibilities include

Research and implement CRDTs on top of IPFS, creating building blocks that can be used by other applications.

Research Cryptographic ACLs (Capabilities Systems) and create building blocks that implement.
Apply this research and implementation to products like PeerPad, validating the solutions and defining new problems to be solved.

## Current endeavours

- [peer-crdt](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-crdt) - An extensible collection of operation-based CRDTs that are meant to work over a p2p network.
- [peer-crdt-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-crdt-ipfs) - IPFS network and storage adapter for peer-crdt.
