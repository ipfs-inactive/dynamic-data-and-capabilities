# Dynamic Data and Capabilities in IPFS Working Group

[![#ipfs-dynamic-data](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs--dynamic--data-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-dynamic-data)

> Research and development of building blocks that enable collaborative applications, providing solutions for security, identity, access control, concurrency, synchronization, offline and near-real-time collaboration on top of IPFS.

## Responsibilities include

Research and implement CRDTs on top of IPFS, creating building blocks that can be used by other applications.

Research Cryptographic ACLs (Capabilities Systems) and create building blocks that implement.
Apply this research and implementation to products like PeerPad, validating the solutions and defining new problems to be solved.

## Current endeavours

- [Peer-Star](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app) - support for building DApps on top of IPFS.
- [Peer-Pad](https://peerpad.net) - a decentralized editor that allows concurrent writing of text. Besides making live changes to a given document, it allows read-only nodes to follow the changes in real-time. It also allows you to publish a self-contained snapshot of the document to IPFS.
- [delta-crdts](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-delta-crdts#delta-crdts) - Delta-state-based CRDTs in JavaScript.
