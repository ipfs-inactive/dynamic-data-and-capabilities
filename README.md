# Dynamic Data and Capabilities in IPFS Working Group

[![#ipfs-dynamic-data](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs--dynamic--data-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-dynamic-data)

> Research and development of building blocks that enable collaborative applications, providing solutions for security, identity, access control, concurrency, synchronization, offline and near-real-time collaboration on top of IPFS.

## Responsibilities include

- Research and implement CRDTs on top of IPFS, creating building blocks that can be used by other applications.
- Research Cryptographic ACLs (Capabilities Systems) and create building blocks that implement.
- Apply this research and implementation to products like PeerPad, validating the solutions and defining new problems to be solved.

## Bi-Weekly Sync

Join us on our bi-weekly calls. For that, check out [the global IPFS community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC).

## Accomplishments and current endeavours

- [Peer-Star](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app): a library to help create DApps on top of IPFS.
- [Peer-Pad](https://peerpad.net): a decentralized editor that allows concurrent writing of text. Besides making live changes to a given document, it allows read-only nodes to follow the changes in real-time. It also allows you to publish a self-contained snapshot of the document to IPFS.
- [delta-crdts](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-delta-crdts#delta-crdts): delta-state-based CRDTs in JavaScript.
- 2 research RFPs:
  - [Optimize storage and convergence time in causal CmRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/9)
  - [Decentralised Access Control in CRDTs](https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/8)
- [Identity RFC](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/blob/c249510b4873a9a4b58b245bf97dbe48513a2689/docs/rfc-identity.md): an identity management system for DApps.
- [Discussify](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/discussify/): Fully decentralized platform for discussing anything on the web.
